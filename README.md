Booster
=======

2D Platformer VideoGame using MonoGame

Booster v1.0.0 is ready to play.
Unfortunately, in this version it isn't possible to config the buttons and keys ingame.
It's necessary to config the buttons and keys manually in config.xml.
By default, Space is for jumping, and "1" is for using the ability "Boost".

The link for downloading this version is inside the file "download.txt".
